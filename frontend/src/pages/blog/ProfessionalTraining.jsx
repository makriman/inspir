                        You've sat through the training. You took notes. You nodded along. You even participated in the breakout sessions. Two weeks later, you can barely remember what the training was about, let alone apply what you supposedly learned.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        This isn't because you're a bad learner. It's because most professional development is designed to be completed, not to create actual learning. Here's how to make training actually stick.
                      </p>
        
                      <h2>Why Most Training Fails</h2>
        
                      <p>
                        Companies spend billions on professional development every year. Employees spend countless hours in training sessions. And yet, studies consistently show that people forget most of what they learned within days.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        The problem isn't the content. Most training programs cover genuinely useful material. The problem is the delivery and what happens after.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>It's Too Passive</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Sit in a room (or on a Zoom call), listen to someone talk, maybe watch some slides. That's how most training works. It's the same passive learning approach that doesn't work in school, and it doesn't work here either.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Listening to information doesn't mean you'll remember it or be able to apply it. Your brain needs to actively work with the material for it to stick.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>There's No Follow-Up</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Training ends, you go back to your regular work, and that's it. Maybe there's a quick quiz at the end to check a compliance box, but there's no real assessment of whether you understood anything or can apply it.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Without follow-up practice and review, you forget. It's not a matter of if—it's guaranteed. Your brain doesn't hold onto information you don't use.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>It's Not Connected to Real Work</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        The training uses generic examples that sort of relate to your job but don't quite match what you actually do. So when you get back to work, you're not sure how to apply what you learned to your specific situation.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Abstract knowledge that isn't tied to concrete application gets forgotten fast.
                      </p>
        
                      <h2>How to Actually Learn From Training</h2>
        
                      <h3>Before the Training: Set a Goal</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Don't go into training with a passive "let's see what this is about" mindset. Before it starts, ask yourself: What specific problem am I trying to solve? What skill do I need to improve? What do I want to be able to do after this training that I can't do now?
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Having a clear goal gives you something to focus on during the training. Instead of trying to absorb everything (impossible), you're looking for specific information that helps you achieve your goal.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>During the Training: Take Better Notes</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Stop transcribing everything the instructor says. That's not note-taking—it's dictation, and it doesn't help you learn.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Instead, write down:
                      </p>
        
                      <ul>
                        <li>Key concepts in your own words</li>
                        <li>How this relates to your actual work</li>
                        <li>Specific examples or scenarios where you'd use this</li>
                        <li>Questions you have</li>
                        <li>Things you want to try when you get back to work</li>
                      </ul>
        
                      <p>
                        These notes are way more useful than a word-for-word transcript of the lecture.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>During the Training: Ask "How Would I Use This?"</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Every time you learn a new concept or technique, pause and think about a real situation from your work where you could apply it.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Don't wait until later to figure this out. Do it now, while the information is fresh and the instructor is available to clarify.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>Right After the Training: Self-Quiz</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Before you leave the training (or close the webinar), spend five minutes testing yourself on what you learned.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Without looking at your notes, try to answer:
                      </p>
        
                      <ul>
                        <li>What were the main concepts covered?</li>
                        <li>How do they apply to my work?</li>
                        <li>What's one thing I'm going to do differently starting tomorrow?</li>
                      </ul>
        
                      <p>
                        If you can't answer these questions, you didn't really learn anything. Better to figure that out now while you can still review the materials or ask questions.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>That Evening: Create Quiz Questions</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Go through your notes and create quiz questions based on the training. Focus on application questions, not just recall.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Bad question: "What are the four principles of effective communication?"
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Better question: "You need to deliver negative feedback to an employee who's consistently late. Using the communication principles from training, how would you structure that conversation?"
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Creating questions forces you to think about the material more deeply. And you'll use these questions for review later.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>The Next Day: Apply Something</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Don't wait until you have the "perfect opportunity" to use what you learned. Find or create an opportunity immediately.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Learned a new Excel technique? Use it on your next spreadsheet, even if your old method would work fine.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Learned a communication framework? Use it in your next email or conversation.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Learned a project management methodology? Apply it to a small project this week.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        The act of using new knowledge in a real context cements it in a way that just reviewing notes never will.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>One Week Later: Quiz Yourself</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Pull out those quiz questions you created and try to answer them without looking at your notes.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        This is probably harder than you expect. You've started to forget, which is exactly why this step is crucial. When you struggle to recall information and then successfully retrieve it, you're strengthening that memory.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        For anything you couldn't remember or got wrong, review that section of your notes and try to use it at work in the next few days.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>One Month Later: Final Review</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Quiz yourself one more time. By now, you've either internalized the material through regular use at work, or you've forgotten it.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        If you've forgotten it, you have two options: either it wasn't important and you can let it go, or it is important and you need to review it and create more opportunities to use it.
                      </p>
        
                      <h2>For Training Providers: How to Design Better Training</h2>
        
                      <p>
                        If you're responsible for creating or delivering training, here's how to make it more effective:
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>Build in Active Practice</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Don't just lecture. Every 10-15 minutes, give participants a chance to practice what you just taught.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        This could be:
                      </p>
        
                      <ul>
                        <li>A quick exercise or problem to solve</li>
                        <li>A discussion question where they apply the concept</li>
                        <li>A case study they analyze using the framework you taught</li>
                        <li>Pair work where they teach each other</li>
                      </ul>
        
                      <p>
                        Active practice is uncomfortable and takes more time than just presenting information. Do it anyway. It's the difference between training that works and training that's forgotten.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>Use Real Scenarios</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Generic examples don't stick. Use real situations from your participants' work.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Before the training, ask participants to submit examples of problems they're facing or situations where they need this skill. Use those as your case studies and examples during training.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>Provide Follow-Up Quizzes</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Send participants quiz questions a day after training, a week after, and a month after. Make them application-focused, not just recall.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        This serves two purposes: it forces participants to review the material (spaced repetition), and it shows you what's actually sticking versus what's being forgotten.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Tools like inspir can generate these questions automatically from your training materials, saving you the time of creating them manually.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>Create Job Aids</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Not everything needs to be memorized. For processes or frameworks that people won't use every day, create simple job aids they can reference when needed.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        A one-page checklist or flowchart that sits on someone's desk is more useful than trying to make them memorize 15 steps they'll forget anyway.
                      </p>
        
                      <h3>Measure Application, Not Completion</h3>
        
                      <p>
                        Stop measuring training success by how many people completed it. That tells you nothing about whether they learned or can apply what you taught.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Instead, measure:
                      </p>
        
                      <ul>
                        <li>Can they apply the concepts to real scenarios? (Test this with case studies or quizzes)</li>
                        <li>Are they actually using what they learned in their work? (Follow up with managers or observe behavior)</li>
                        <li>Has performance improved in the areas the training addressed?</li>
                      </ul>
        
                      <p>
                        This is harder to measure than completion rates, but it's what actually matters.
                      </p>
        
                      <h2>Making It Work in Reality</h2>
        
                      <p>
                        Look, I know you're busy. You don't have hours to spend reviewing training materials. That's exactly why you need a system.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Five minutes of self-quizzing right after training beats an hour of passive review a week later. Ten minutes of actually applying what you learned beats any amount of note-taking.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Professional development is an investment of your time and your company's money. Don't waste it by treating training as something to sit through and check off a list.
                      </p>
        
                      <p>
                        Engage actively, quiz yourself, apply what you learned, and review over time. That's how training becomes actual skill development instead of just another meeting on your calendar.
                      </p>
